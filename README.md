This repository containts an implementation of a JPDA filter with some extentions such as a M/N heuristic to achieve a dynamic number of targets, a comparisson with GNN, and some visualizations. The JPDA filter is applied to a video of traffic to estimate trajectories of traffic participants. For more information, see the included report.

Tip: You can reduce the playback speed of the video to see a bit more clearly what is going on each timestep.
